## 📝 Project Description
This project aims to build a secure food ordering environment for people with dietary, allergic, or religious eating restrictions. 
To guarantee the safety of the users, we used the **Stellar Blockchain** technology to assure the immutability and transparency of the verifications made by verified auditors.

**Live Demo:** [Link to Deployed App](https://your-demo-link.com) (if available)

## 🎯 The Problem
Finding safe and trustworthy food options is a daily challenge for millions of people with specific dietary needs. Whether due to severe allergies, religious laws (like Halal or Kosher), or lifestyle choices (like veganism), the risk of cross-contamination or misinformation can have serious consequences. There is often a lack of a single source of truth to verify a restaurant's claims.

##💡 Our Solution
**Food For All** leverages the Stellar Blockchain to create a decentralized and tamper-proof ledger of food certifications. Each time a registered auditor verifies a restaurant's dish or kitchen, the certification is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. This creates a permanent, transparent, and easily auditable record that consumers can trust.

## ✨ Key Features
- **User Profiles:** Create a profile specifying allergies, dietary restrictions (e.g., gluten-free, vegan), and religious requirements (e.g., Kosher, Halal).
- **Verified Listings:** Search for restaurants and dishes with a "Blockchain Verified" seal of approval.
- **Transparent History:** View the complete verification history of any item, including who the auditor was and when the verification occurred.
- **Auditor Dashboard:** A dedicated portal for certified auditors to submit their findings to the blockchain.
- **Immutable Trust:** Once a verification is on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Restaurant Onboarding:** Restaurants register their business and submit dishes for verification.
2.  **Auditor Verification:** A certified and independent auditor physically or digitally inspects the restaurant's ingredients, preparation process, and kitchen environment.
3.  **Record to Blockchain:** Upon successful verification, the auditor submits a signed report which is recorded as metadata on a Stellar transaction.
4.  **User Confirmation:** The user scans a QR code or browses the app to view the dish's verification status, directly pulling the immutable data from the Stellar network.
